                            During my freshman year, I got to know one of my spiritual companions 
                            by meeting up with him a couple of times a week. 
                            It set the foundation for my Christian pursuit during college.

                            To this day, I still pray with a student I met in the club here. 
                            We can request prayer from one another at any time, in any place. 
                            It's nice to know that I always have someone to turn to, even if 
                            we're on opposite coasts.

                            The appointments I had with a staff member rescued my Christian 
                            life. Without a doubt, I would not be here without those times.

                in units of two and three, especially as we get busier during the semester. It's a great 
                way to stay connected, to develop a support system, and, ultimately, to sustain our 
                Christian pursuit while we are here in school.</p>
