                you're just eating instant noodles every day? Or maybe you are stuck somewhere 
                in your Christian life and you need some more experienced Christians to give

                in their homes Thursday and Friday night for home-cooked meals, a place to 
                rest, and much-needed fellowship. Praise the Lord for a house-to-house 
                Christian life!</p>
