                <p className="paragraph">Are you away from home for the first time in your life? Do you feel like 
                you're just eating instant noodles every day? Or maybe you are stuck somewhere 
                in your Christian life and you need some more experienced Christians to give 
                you some guidance? Small groups are one way to meet those needs.</p>

                <p className="paragraph">There are many Berkeley alumni around the area who graciously host students 
                in their homes Thursday and Friday night for home-cooked meals, a place to 
                rest, and much-needed fellowship. Praise the Lord for a house-to-house 
                Christian life!</p>
